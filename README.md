Congressional Votes Linked With Donors
=====================================

Just a project to satisfy my curiosity to see which congressional votes are bought by which industries/donors.

Unfortunately, bills are rather loosely linked to votes using GovTrack; so it's necessary to search for keywords in all of the congressional vote records. Thus, it is necessary to give it a starting congress number (currently 114) to work backwords from.

## Usage
Starting the script:
```
bundle install
bundle exec ruby congress-finance.rb
```

When asked:
```
What's the vote you're searching for?
```

Type a keyword to find a vote, e.g. "Recreational Firearms" and press enter

When asked:
```
Congress to start searching from?
```

Type the congress to search backword from and press enter. Congress number this cycle is 114

When asked:
```
Maximum number of votes to analyse?
```

Type the number of different congressional votes with this keyword you would like to see and press enter
